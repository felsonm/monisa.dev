    <h1>print(‘Hello World’) </h1>

    <p>I am a full stack developer based in Pennsylvania, USA. I have worked with computer programming indirectly as a recruiter of aspiring data scientist talents and directly building websites and developing back-end solutions for a variety of projects. 
    </p>

    <p>Programming as a career was a decision I made back in 2021 when I was looking for a new intellectual stimulating professional pathway. Today, programming is more than a profession for me. It’s actually a life style. Everyday, I code, I drink coffee and I use my creativity no matter if I am working on an independent project or hired by someone to do some coding. </p>
